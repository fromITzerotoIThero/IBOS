# IBOS - I Build On Strengths üöÄ

Welcome to IBOS (I Build On Strengths), a mock online shop selling conference freebies inspired by Gallup StrengthsFinder Themes.    
This project is my training field for learning React.js - it's an implementation of a React-based front-end with a Supabase back-end, emphasizing the use of functional components and CSS Modules.    
Thank you for checking out this repository!

## üöß Code Under Construction üöß
Dear Visitor!  
  
  Just a heads-up, this project was started when I was as fresh as one can be in programming üê§ (I barely even knew JS syntax back then! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).  
  If you're interested in checking out my coding skills, here are some of my latest commits:

1. https://github.com/fromITzerotoIThero/IBOS/commit/2c4d466aaee8335611c77898648e7b288bbe26c1

2. https://github.com/fromITzerotoIThero/IBOS/blob/master/src/components/BasicCard/BasicCard.tsx

I very much appreciate code refactoring ‚ù§Ô∏è, but with a ton of things on my learning plate, I'm focusing on adding new features rather than fine-tuning the old code.  

# 1. Introduction

IBOS is a fictional online store where you can explore and purchase products related to Gallup StrengthsFinder Themes. 
The project has been created solely for the purpose of learning different aspects of web development and building a React application. 

# 2. Demo
Live
To see IBOS in action, visit the live demo at https://ibos.netlify.app/.

GitHub Repository
You can also explore the source code and contribute to the project on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/fromITzerotoIThero/IBOS .

# 3. Installation
## Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js
- Internet browser (Firefox, Chrome, Edge... anything will work just fine)
- Any modern IDE (integrated development environment), e.g. VS Code will work great, and is free

## Setup

After cloning this project open console in the project directory and run:

```
npm install
```

## Running

During the development, the "developer server" needs to be started. It takes all of the project files, compiles them, and hosts a http server on local machine. In order to run that server you can either open a terminal and run:

```
npm start
```

Alternatively, if you are using VS Code, you can open debug view in the sidebar, on the "run and debug" dropdown choose "Launch development server", and click on the green "run" button next to it.

## Local application

Once the development server has been started, you can open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser. Any changes that are made in the code will be immediately detected by the server, compiled and the browser will refresh, showing the latest changes. There is no need to restart the development server or to refresh the website in the browser.

Alternatively, if you are using VS Code, you will have the option to open the application webpage and debug it right from the IDE. In order to do so, open the debug view in the sidebar, on the "run and debug" dropdown choose the browser that you want to use for debugging:

- Firefox
- Chrome
- Edge

# 4. Usage

Feel free to explore and use the IBOS app. Here's what you can do:

- Browse products based on Gallup StrengthsFinder Themes.
- Learn more about each Theme.

Coming up:
- Add products to your cart.
- Check out using the demo payment feature (Note: No actual transactions occur).

 # 5. Technologies
 IBOS is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

## Front-end:
- React: The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- JSX: A JavaScript syntax extension for rendering components.
- CSS Modules: Local scoping of styles for enhanced modularity.

## Back-end:
- Supabase: A back-end as a service (BaaS) that provides a PostgreSQL database and authentication services. Special thanks to our mentor for setting up the back-end.

## Development:
- GitHub: Version control and collaboration.
- Netlify: Hosting and continuous deployment for the live demo.
