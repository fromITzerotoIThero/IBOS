/* Problems encoutered:
1. with the min-height set on the .header, the flex-items for some reason didn't have the same height
    (since they're flex I'd expect them to be the height of the heighest flex-item, that is the height of the navbar__entries with icons?)
    and it caused the .navbar__entries without icons have the horizontal grey bar appear higher, not at the bottom of the container(?)

2. I managed to fix this with setting min-height on the .navbar__entry - is it a good approach?

3. I've also set min-width on the .navbar__entry in order to make the grey bar wider as in the penpot designs. */
