                The project has been created solely for the purpose of learning different aspects of web development and building a React application with global state management using Redux.

                Please note that the images and descriptions of the products were AI-generated, so it's advisable to take them with a pinch (a rather big one, I should say) of salt.

                Gallup Domains & Themes are, on the other hand, a real (and amazing!) deal and feel free to delve into them.
